### Installation/ Configuration:

1. Restore necessary **node_modules**, so run the following command in **GIT Bash Console** in the application **COVID19MAP-Client** and **COVID19MAP-Server** root directory

   ```
   - npm install
   ```

2. Restore necessary application packages and dependencies, so run the following command in **GIT Bash Console** in the application **COVID19MAP-Client** root directory

   ```
   - yarn install
   ```

4. Start the application server side on **3001 PORT**, so run the following command in **GIT Bash Console** in the application **COVID19MAP-Server** root directory

   ```
   - cross-env PORT=3001 nodemon
   ``` 

5. If the nodemon bach command not found, run the following command in **GIT Bash Console** in the application **COVID19MAP-Server** root directory

   ```
   - npm install -g nodemon
   ```  

6. Start the application client side, so run the following command in **GIT Bash Console** in the application **COVID19MAP-Client** root directory

   ```
   - npm start
   ``` 

7. Insert your **Google API Key**. If you are running the application in an installed environment, you will need to specify the following environment variable **REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY** and its associated **Google Maps API Key**. If you are running the application on localhost, you will need to enter your **Google Maps API Key** in the line below (*src/core/components/App/App.js line: 157*).

   ```javascript
    googleMapURL = {`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=${process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY || 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY'}`}
   ``` 

8. If you are running the application for the first time, you need to invoke the following server method, for example, from a **Postman web client** (in order not to wait an hour). This method initializes the required data. If you are not using on localhost, of course insert the correct path!:

   ```
   http://localhost:3001/update-covid-data
   ``` 

### Data Sources:

The map is based on multiple sources (see below for details). If you are interested, the integrated dataset can be found here. Note that numbers in different data sources may not match with each other exactly.

The application uses the following data set as the data source (Based on data provided by Johns Hopkins University (JHU)): https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports

I cite data sources according to the data sources listed in the GitHub repository published by Johns Hopkins University (JHU) (I made the summons on April 14, 2020 https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19):
